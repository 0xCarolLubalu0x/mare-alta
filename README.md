# 🌊 Maré Alta — Digital Community Recognition

**Maré Alta** is a Web3 social impact platform that turns real-world actions into verifiable digital memory on Solana.

Every day, thousands of people plant, teach, and care for their communities — but these offline actions often become invisible in the digital world.  
Maré Alta bridges this gap, creating **Soulbound Digital Badges (non-transferable NFTs)** that record verified impact.

## 🚀 Features

- **In-person check-ins** using QR codes and GPS.  
- **Three-step verification** system ensures only real participants receive badges.  
- **Soulbound NFTs** build social reputation and contribution history.  
- **Dual sustainability model:**  
  - Support NFTs (sponsorships for local collectives).  
  - White-label licensing for organizations and municipalities.  
- **Privacy-first:** volunteers can remain anonymous and self-custody their tokens.
